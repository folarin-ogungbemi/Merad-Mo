# Milestone Project 2

## Introduction

This website was created for the purpose of completing my second milestone project as a Code Institute student of a full-stack Software Developer course. This Project demonstrates the knowledge acquired afer the completion of the modules required to build the website. Technologies used for the Architectural design and interactive structure are majorly based on HTML, CSS, UX Design, and Javascript programming language. See below, in technology section of this documentation, a detailed list of technologies used for the completion of the project.
